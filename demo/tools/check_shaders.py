"""The demo's shaders must be the plugin's shaders, character for character.

    python3 demo/tools/check_shaders.py           compare; exit 1 on any drift
    python3 demo/tools/check_shaders.py --write   regenerate demo/shaders.js

Called from `tools/verify.sh`. Exit code 1 means a copy has drifted.

------------------------------------------------------------------- why

`demo/shaders.js` holds the GLSL pieces of `source/Shaders.cpp` (the kCommon
library, kQuadVertex, the generator, the intake, the map pass's library and
fragment, the two glow passes and the composite) plus kVersion. That is two
copies of the same text, and two copies drift -- quietly, because a contour
drawn by a *plausible* shader looks exactly like one drawn by the right one.
The whole claim of the page is that it runs the plugin's own shaders, so the
claim needs something enforcing it. `ihtest` drives the real plugin class and
has never heard of this page, and `tools/glslc.sh` compiles the C++ copies and
never looks at the JS one.

------------------------------------------------------------------- what it does

Pulls each piece out of `source/Shaders.cpp` and the matching backtick literal
out of `demo/shaders.js`, and compares them exactly -- no whitespace
normalisation, no comment stripping: a comment updated on one side only is
exactly the drift worth catching. `kVersion`, a plain string, is compared too.

A piece may be several adjacent raw strings (MSVC refuses one literal over
about 16 KB, C2026); this joins them as the compiler does, with nothing
between. None of isohypse's pieces needs that today.

It also fails when Shaders.cpp grows a piece this script does not list (a new
pass the page would silently lack), and it checks the JOIN as well as the
pieces: `Assemble()` in Shaders.cpp is kVersion + kCommon + each piece in turn,
and InitGL in Isohypse.cpp builds the quad vertex stage as kVersion +
kQuadVertex and each fragment stage with Assemble() -- the map pass from two
pieces, kMapLibrary then kMapFragment. plugin.js must assemble them the same
way. A change to either side's assembly fails here and needs a reader.

The one transformation is a decode, not a normalisation: a backtick cannot
appear raw inside a template literal, so --write escapes one as \\`. kMapFragment
has three, in comments. This undoes that escape and REJECTS any other backslash
or any `${` on the JS side; there are none in the C++ bodies, so either could
only be somebody hiding a difference.

`--write` produces shaders.js from the C++ by exactly that escape, so the copy
is spliced by this script and never typed.

------------------------------------------------------------------- what it cannot

Nothing here checks the PORTED half: Controls.cpp (the mappings), SweepClock.cpp
(the sweep's clock), Worlds.cpp (the table, the PNG decode and the gap filler)
and the frame logic of Isohypse.cpp's ProcessOpenGL in demo/plugin.js are a hand
translation. demo/tools/crosscheck/ renders the plugin's own harness and the
page at the same settings and compares the pictures; it is run by hand (it
needs a GPU and Chrome), not by verify.sh. When you change one of those, change
the port too.
